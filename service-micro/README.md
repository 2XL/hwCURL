[Microservices from Theory to Practice:](https://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redbooks/pdfs/sg248275.pdf)



* What are Micro-services?
    * Unbundled services
    * Bounded contexts
    * Exposed through APIs
    * Minimal dependencies
    * Assembled to form applications
    * Distinguished from monolithic applications

A microservice is an independently deployable component of bounded scope that support interoperability through message-based communication.
Microservice architecture is a style of engineering highly-automated, evolvable software systems made up of capability-aligned microservices.


* Micro-services: Small autonomous services that work together
